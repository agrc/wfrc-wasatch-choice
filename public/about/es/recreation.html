  The Wasatch Front region is endowed with a stunning natural setting. One of
  the challenges we have as growth continues is to ensure residents have
  sufficient open space and recreational opportunities that are also easy to
  access. Are we sufficiently bringing recreation and trails into our
  neighborhoods? Is there a park within walking distance of every home? What
  public amenities will meet our needs in the future?

  <em>Parks and public spaces</em> range from  natural, untouched landscapes to parks or even city plazas.  These spaces offer health benefits to those that use them, such as lower rates of cardiovascular disease, higher rates of cognitive function in children, and improved mental health. As areas where people have fun together, these spaces also connect us with each other and improve our overall sense of community. Many types of public spaces also benefit the physical environment by, for example, absorbing stormwater runoff, offering habitat for birds and pollinators, and providing areas that help cool our cities..
</p>
<p>
  Setting local goals, such as <a href="https://www.nrpa.org/publications-research/ParkMetrics/" target="_blank">for parkspace per household and access to public spaces</a>, is a first step toward providing recreational spaces in growth areas.
</p>
<p>
  After establishing goals funding and other acquisitions are needed to make new parks and public spaces a reality.
</p>
<p>
  Linking parks and public spaces with safe walking, rolling, or biking ensures they can be enjoyed by people of all incomes and abilities.
