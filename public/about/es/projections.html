  <b><u>Population and Employment Projections</u></b><br>Utah's population continues to grow. Internal growth, from our
  own kids and grandkids, continues to be the largest source of growth. To successfully plan for our region's future, we
  all must have a good idea of where people will live and work in the future.

  The Wasatch Front Real Estate Market Model (REMM), developed by WFRC and MAG using UrbanSim software, helps to better
  understand current and future locations of households and jobs. REMM forecasts the population and employment
  distribution within each county to small area traffic analysis zone (TAZ) geography. The overall county totals are
  developed by the University of Utah's Gardner Policy Institute.
