  Coordination improves the ability of workers to access job sites and the efficiency with which goods are delivered.  The four keys of the Wasatch Choice Vision help us maintain a high quality of life which helps us attract skilled labor and reduces the cost of living and doing business.

  The Economic Development information shown on the map shows several important
  regional policy and geographic considerations: Utah State Economic Clusters,
  Opportunity Zones, CDA and RDA areas, and Transit Oriented Developments. This
  map can easily be cross referenced with information on the transportation and
  land use tabs to help communities identify the most effective locations for
  development and investment, as well as how to maximize use of programs and
  incentives.
</p>
<p>
  <i><b>Utah Strategic Industry Clusters:</b></i>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    The Districts have aligned their economic development efforts with the
    Governor’s Office of Economic Development Strategic Industry Clusters.
    Utah’s industry clusters are aerospace and defense, energy, financial
    services, life sciences, outdoor products and recreation, and software and
    IT. Nurturing industry clusters helps our state sustain a competitive
    business advantage
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <i><b>Opportunity Zones:</b></i>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Opportunity Zones are areas determined by the US census as “low-income
    communities.” Designated Opportunity Zones incentivize private sector
    investments in housing and economic development in these areas by providing
    tax incentives for the developments.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <i
    ><b
      >Community Development Areas (CDA) and Community Reinvestment Areas
      (CRA):</b
    ></i
  >
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    CDAs and CRAs are public financing tools. They temporarily utilize the
    increase in tax revenue spurred by land reinvestment in order to pay for
    things like infrastructure improvements. By doing so they further encourage
    land reinvestment.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <i><b>Transit Oriented Development (TOD):</b></i>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    TOD refers to housing, jobs, and commercial developments focused around
    transit. Development that is well integrated with transit choices provides
    additional transportation choices, and positively impacts the economy
    through increased accessibility to jobs and housing. TOD helps reduce
    household transportation costs, congestion, and emissions of air pollution.
