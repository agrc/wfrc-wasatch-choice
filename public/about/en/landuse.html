  A thriving region requires great places where people can live, work, and play – places that vary from city and town centers to parks and public spaces.

  <b><u>More About Centers</u></b
  ><br />City and town centers are the hearts of a community - walkable areas where activity is focused, with a mix of community destinations, jobs and housing.

<p>
  <strong>Development Intensity</strong>. Wasatch Choice Centers desired approximate development intensities are noted in dwelling units per acre (DUA) and total floor-to-area ratios (FARs incorporate both residential and non-residential buildings addressing all land uses).

  <strong>Benefits</strong>. Residents within or near centers don’t need to drive as far and can more easily choose to walk, bike, and ride transit. Overall this means less traffic congestion and reduced air emissions.  Centers enable people to more easily reach destinations and interact with friends and family.
</p>
<p>
  When centers meet more of the demands of population growth, they reduce growth pressure on single family neighborhoods and rural areas. Allowing additional growth in centers reduces the necessary footprint of urban development elsewhere, which also reduces water usage in the urbanized area.
</p>
<p><i>
  All land use decisions are the purview of cities, towns, and counties working with 
  landowners. The Wasatch Choice Vision and accompanying long-range Regional Transportation 
  Plan represent the expressed long range vision of these local governments.</i>
</p>
<p>As cities, townships and counties shape incentives and regulations that guide new 
  construction and redevelopment, their leadership is critical to successful center 
  development.
