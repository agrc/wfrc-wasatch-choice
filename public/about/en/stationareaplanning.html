    Implementing the Wasatch Choice Vision to preserve and enhance quality of life as Utah grows</i></strong>

<p>
  HB462 (2022) seeks to maximize the development potential, and
  thereby increase the availability and affordability of housing,
  around transit stations. Almost all of the commuter rail, light rail, and BRT stations are within Wasatch
  Choice Centers. Under HB462, cities will work to develop Station Area Plans within
  1/2 mile of rail transit stations and 1/4 mile of BRT stations with
  dedicated lanes, as listed below.
